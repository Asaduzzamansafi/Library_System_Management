# Library_System_Management
This is my 2nd SQL project

## Project Overview
Project Title: Library Management System

Level: Intermediate

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

This image represents the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a Library Management System I designed as part of a recent project. The database schema includes all essential entities and their relationships necessary to efficiently manage a library's operations.

## Objectives
1. Set up the Library Management System Database: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. CTAS (Create Table As Select): Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. Advanced SQL Queries: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.
