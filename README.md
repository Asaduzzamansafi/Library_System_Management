# Library_System_Management
This is my 2nd SQL project

##Project Overview
Project Title: Library Management System
Level: Intermediate

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

This image represents the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a Library Management System I designed as part of a recent project. The database schema includes all essential entities and their relationships necessary to efficiently manage a library's operations.
